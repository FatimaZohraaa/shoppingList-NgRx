# ShoppingListNgrx

This is a quick NgRx practice project that implements an editable shopping list.

The `background-color` of "Sum" changes to green if the sum < 30, and to red if it is > 30.

TODO:

1. Refactor components to facilitate testing
2. Implement unit tests on the store and components
3. Make things presentable
